            wow. It's really been a month. Time sure does fly by fast. Though we only saw each other for like 10 days we sure did a lot in those 10 days. From watching The Blair Witch Project (very cheeks movie ngl) to cramming calc-based (just to be clueless on the final :| ) and everything else in between. I sure was enjoying it and hope you were too :). I wish I could have given you to lotus in person and be able to see how short you hair is now lol. If you haven't opened the gift by now please do(click on it). A picture of us on our second date should pop up :). Click on that picture for a surprise hehehehe ;). luv u
